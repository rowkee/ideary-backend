What is Ideary
Ideary is a place where people can add their ideas, with the hope of attracting other people to help them bring it to life. 

A wise (yet demotivating) person once told me "good ideas are worth shit". They were right, because what they meant that a good idea kept in your head is of no use to anyone.
